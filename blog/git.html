      There are many benefits to version control but the main one is so that everyone involved on a particular project can all add and change the project code without overwriting somone elses code. Without version control everyone would be working off the same flashdrive giving it to one another as they send it round the room, the likelihood of one person overwriting the changes made by another would be quite high. Version control allows team members to update the code anytime anywhere and then merge them together with the main project file.

      Another reason for using version control would be so that you can keep track of the different version of the project. Saving your project after each change is a good idea since you may mess it up and have to begin again. This being said you don't want a hundred of versions of the same project on your computer, so by using Version Control you are updating the one and only project. This project holds all the information about the past versions, including a breif description on what was changed - provided the person making the change added it. This is why version control is also benefical for people working by themselves.

        Git helps in the keeping track of changes by prompting you to add a message accompanying each upload you do to the main project. It also stores information from each past version which, along with the comment made about the change, can be used to backtrack and discover where any potential errors may lie.

        Lastly using GitHub to store your code is a good idea because it is cloud based. This means that anyone who wants to work on the project can do so without having to chase down the person who is in control of the project flashdrive. Using GitHub makes your code remotely accessible and allows changes to be made at any time of the day, or night.
